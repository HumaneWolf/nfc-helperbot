# NFC HelperBot

This is a Telegram Chat bot that is made to assist people at [Nordic FuzzCon](https://nordicfuzzcon.org/) by answering simple questions. You can use this bot by messaging it on Telegram, [@nfchelperbot](https://t.me/nfchelperbot).

The bot will attempt to find out what you are asking using natural language parsing to find how close your input is to a question list, and give what it thinks is an appropriate answer if possible. It was primarily created as an experiment and practice with TypeScript and natural language parsing.
